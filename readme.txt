== Description ==

This plugin is designed to automatically send sales data to the Markight data analysis platform.

Markight is a solution provided by Dataigest company. We started working in 2021 for the purpose of providing a customer analysis platform as a B2B SaaS focused on data-driven retention marketing, a process that helps E-Commerce raise more revenue from their existing customers.
We are a team made up of global professionals who have come together striving to work with the best data scientists and business professionals, aspiring to make a difference with the help of our clients in the field of marketing and customer experience.
Check some of Markight's features below!

##Customer segmentation
Using data science technologies, your company can compute mass amounts of historical transactional data to segment all your customers into different groups with a method called RFM segmentation.

##KPI Monitoring
Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) guides a business towards making the best decisions for better sales and profit, but getting access to day-to-day reports that are actionable often involves using a lot of resources for data gathering and visualization.

##Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis
You must have heard; “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” We believe tracking and analyzing the past is the key to never repeating it. So, we offer an opportunity to track your customers’ post-purchase behavior in the past to help you implement effective strategies today in order to avoid losing them in the future.

##Churn Prediction
Using data, algorithms and machine learning, this tool predicts customer churn before it occurs. To benefit from this feature, you can select a specific time period or customer segment to answer questions such as:

Will my customers churn in the next x days?
Which customer segment is likely to churn in the next x days?

##Time between Purchases
Based on your customers’ purchase behavior in the past, this analysis examines the average customer repurchase rate for the second, third, and subsequent purchases to predict their future buying patterns. With the help of this, you can identify customers with the following characteristics:

Customers on the verge of churning
Customers on the verge of purchasing
Customers with an extended time gap between their purchases
Customers with a short time gap between their purchases

##Product Performance
Having to manage an abundance of products, it’s common for category managers who work in retailers to spend the majority of their time on short term objectives such as setting meetings, conducting negotiations and attending day-to-day tasks. There’s simply too little time to create a viable long-term, data-driven strategy, and even if there were, the existing systems seem almost impossible to overhaul or design.
